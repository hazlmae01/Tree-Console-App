# Tree-Console-App

# Introduction

The Flight Booking Console System is a Java-based application that simulates a flight booking system. It uses a tree data structure to represent a network of destinations and their sub-routes, allowing users to navigate and manage routes effectively. This console-based tool provides a simple and practical interface for interacting with hierarchical data.

# Describe what it can do

**Add Routes:**
- Users can add new destinations under existing ones.
- This helps grow the list of available routes.

**View All Routes:**
- Shows all destinations and their connections in a clear way.
- Helps users see the full list of routes.

**Book Flights:**
Users can search for a destination to book a flight.
Once the destination is found, they can confirm their booking.

**Exit:**
Users can leave the program anytime by choosing the "Exit" option.
This closes the application easily after finishing tasks.

# Why this Application
The Flight Booking Console System shows how tree data structures can be used in real-life situations, like organizing routes, sub-routes, and connections in a flight booking system. It helps developers by giving a simple example of how to add, search, and navigate through tree data in Java. For users, it provides a basic system to manage and book flights, which can be improved with more features in the future. Overall, this system makes it easier to understand how data structures work and how they can solve real-world problems, especially in travel and transportation.
