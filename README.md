#Introduction

The Flight Booking Console System is a Java-based application that simulates a flight booking system. It uses a tree data structure to represent a network of destinations and their sub-routes, allowing users to navigate and manage routes effectively. This console-based tool provides a simple and practical interface for interacting with hierarchical data.
